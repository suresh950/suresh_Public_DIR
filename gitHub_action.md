# GitHub Action

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool provided by GitHub that enables developers to automate tasks 
related to their software development workflows. It allows for the creation of custom workflows, which can be 
triggered by various events, such as pushes to a repository, pull requests, or scheduled events. These 
workflows can be used for multiple purposes, **including Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment 
(CD),** testing, and more.
